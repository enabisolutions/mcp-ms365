# Security Advisories

Last reviewed: 2026-05-03 by daniel@enabi.io.

`npm audit` is run before every release. Each advisory below has been triaged
against Enabi's actual usage (mail/calendar/contacts in stdio mode). Re-review
whenever `npm audit` surfaces something new or when a fix becomes available
without a breaking upgrade.

We do not call uuid directly — it is a transitive dependency of msal-node, which uses uuid internally without that argument. The fix requires upgrading @azure/msal-node 3.x → 5.x (breaking change). Defer until we plan the msal upgrade. |
